TrueSkill-Server
================

A TrueSkill Server (Python, Javascript and HTML/CSS)

Uses the Bottle web framework in Python, and has the configurations 
at the top of index.py, by default running on port 8085 of the localhost, 
where it was developed and tested, or running under uwsgi just fine with
the uwsgi.ini file provided here (or some locally tuned variant).
