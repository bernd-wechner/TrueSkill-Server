    <h1>Using the TrueSkill Server</h1>
    <p>[<a href="/">Home</a>] [<a href="credits.html">Acknowledgements</a>]</p>
    <p>TrueSkill is one of the most lauded methods of rating and ranking
      game players developed to date.<br>
    </p>
    <p>This TrueSkill server provides access to the TrueSkill updates
      via either a form entry or URL.</p>
    <p>In either instance understanding the TrueSkill parameters will be
      essential.</p>
    <h2>TrueSkill Parameters</h2>
    <p>TrueSkill models a players skill with two distinct parameters,
      each of which is measured in arbitrary units we can call skill
      points:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A mean (µ) - which represents an estimate of the skill the
        player has. The higher the mean the more skilled the player is
        judged to be, the lower the mean the less skilled.</li>
      <li>A standard deviation (σ) - which represents an estimate of the
        uncertainty surrounding that skill. The higher the standard
        deviation the less sure we are, the lower the more sure. It is
        the opposite of confidence.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The beauty and importance of this is that TrueSkill starts
      everyone off with a given measure of skill (mean,&nbsp;µ) and high
      uncertainty (standard deviation, σ).</p>
    <p>Every player is given the same initial value of mean and standard
      deviation and each time a game is recorded, the means are adjusted
      standard deviations will drop (confidence rises). Specifically
      TrueSkill will take points away from the losers and given to the
      winners so that they total number of points among all players in a
      game remains the same. These are labelled:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An initial mean (µ<sub>0</sub>) - being the initial value of
        the mean (µ) assigned to each player (before any game data is
        collected to measure their performance).</li>
      <li>An initial standard deviation (σ<sub>0</sub>) - being the
        initial value of standard deviation (σ) assigned to each player
        (before any game data is collected to measure their
        performance).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A third number is associated with each player, which is a
      conservative measure of skill. The mean (µ) is a measure of the
      presumed skill, but the standard deviation (σ) describes how
      uncertain we are about that. The conservative measure of skill
      then is calculated as a single number from the mean and standard
      deviation. This is the single number used for ranking players and
      comparing their skill level and represents the level of skill we
      are confident they have, at least. It could be higher, and the
      more games they play the lower the standard deviation will fall
      as uncertainty drops and confidence rises.</p>
    <p>This TrueSkill server defines the conservative skill measure as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rating (η) = µ − (µ<sub>0</sub> ÷ σ<sub>0</sub>) × σ</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The rating at outset is thus by definition, 0:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Initial Rating (η<sub>0</sub>) = µ<sub>0</sub>−(µ<sub>0</sub>
        ÷ σ<sub>0</sub>) × σ<sub>0</sub> = µ<sub>0</sub> −µ<sub>0</sub>
        = 0</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With this understanding you can now interpret all of the
      TrueSkill parameters.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:2em"><strong>Side note:</strong> The TrueSkill
      documentation never gives this conservative measure of skill a
      name or symbol, but loosely implies that it is called the true skill.
      This server was developed specifically as a first step towards
      supporting leaderboard rankings for a competitive gamers group
      calling themselves <a href="https://leaderboard.space">CoGs</a> 
      (for <strong>Co</strong>mpetitive <strong>G</strong>amer<strong>s</strong>),
      and so true skill is named rating (in the manner of chess ratings) and 
      measured in teeth (cogs have teeth) alluding also to the voracity of 
      any given player (like the teeth of a lion) and the Greek symbol eta 
      (η) chosen as intentional pun on teeth (eater) and conveniently resembling 
      the letter n (for number of teeth).</p>
    <h3>Player Parameters (for a given game result)</h3>
    <p>These parameters are specific to the the players (and/or teams)
      playing the game.</p>
    <table class="deflist" width="80%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td class="deflist" nowrap="nowrap">Place</td>
          <td class="deflist">A number indicating the placing. The first
            player would be 1, the second 2, the third 3 etc. Ties can
            be entered so if two players tied in second place for
            example they would both have a Place of 2. The actual number
            is not relevant to the TrueSkill calculation, players are
            simply sorted by Place to determine who beat whom. The
            winners taking points away from the losers respectively.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="deflist" nowrap="nowrap">Name</td>
          <td class="deflist">The name of the player. Each player must
            have a unique name but otherwise, it's not relevant to the
            TrueSkill calculation excepting that the results are listed
            by name again. This is your identifier for each player. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="deflist" nowrap="nowrap">Mean (µ)</td>
          <td class="deflist">The current mean (as described above)
            which the player has before the game you're recording was
            played. TrueSkill will undertake to calculate a new mean
            based on this players placing in the game.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="deflist" nowrap="nowrap">Standard Deviation (σ)</td>
          <td class="deflist">The current standard deviation (as
            described above) which the player has before the game you're
            recording was played. TrueSkill will undertake to calculate
            a new standard deviation based on the game parameters you
            specified.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="deflist" nowrap="nowrap">Partial Play Weighting (ω)</td>
          <td class="deflist">A weighting for partial play. Let's say a
            given player could not play the game to completion because
            the wife called and was having a baby. Well, you can
            estimate what portion of the game they did play and this
            will moderate how much TrueSkill adjusts their mean and
            standard deviation results. The default of 1, is playing to
            completion, 0 in turn means they didn't even start, their
            mean and standard deviation won't be touched, why are you
            enterig them at all? And 0.5 would mean they played for half
            the game, 0.75, <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> of the game and
            0.25, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> of the game and so on.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <h4>Team Play</h4>
    <p>TrueSkill supports team play (in fact individual play is just
      modeled as teams of 1 internally). In which case there is Place
      and Name for each team, and each player has a Name but no Place.
      In other words all the players in one team score together the same
      placing. </p>
    <h3>Game Parameters</h3>
    <p>These parameters are specific to the game being played. Each game
      will have it's own unique set of parameters, though TrueSkill
      provides some convenient defaults.</p>
    <table class="deflist" width="80%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td class="deflist" nowrap="nowrap">Initial Mean (µ<sub>0</sub>)</td>
          <td class="deflist">The initial value of the mean as described
            above. The default value in TrueSkill is 25 points. This is
            completely arbitrary and you could use any value. Important
            only is that for any given game, league or leaderboard you
            are managing that all players who enter do so with the same
            initial mean - to be consistent and fair.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="deflist" nowrap="nowrap">Initial Standard Deviation
            (σ<sub>0</sub>)</td>
          <td class="deflist">The initial value of the standard
            deviation as described above.
            <p>The default value is one third of the initial mean, or 25
              ÷ 3, which is 8<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> or 8.333... if
              you prefer. </p>
            <p>This is a completely arbitrary but a value that worked
              empirically for the TrueSkill developers in their initial
              environment (the Xbox matchmaking system). </p>
            <p>You can use any value you like, but the server constrains
              you to use one that is not greater than the initial mean
              (said another way, let us not begin with uncertainty
              greater than the measure).</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="deflist" nowrap="nowrap">Skill Factor (ß)</td>
          <td class="deflist">Described in the literature as the
            difference in µ values that would map to approximately 80%
            chance of the higher µ holder of winning. Meaning: The
            Trueskill authors argue that this reflects the balance of
            skill and luck in a game. If ß is high more luck is modeled,
            and if it is low, more skill. <br>
            <p>The default value is one sixth of the initial mean, or 25
              ÷ 6, which is 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub> or 4.166... if
              you prefer. </p>
            <p>This again is completely arbitrary but a value that
              worked empirically for the TrueSkill developers in their
              initial environment (the Xbox matchmaking system).</p>
            <p>It turns out they did some subsequent research comparing 
            actual game outcomes against Trueskill predictions to tune ß.
            They arrived at the following values as guidelines for Xbox
            games:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li>3.33 for Golf (a game of almost pure skill)</li>
            	<li>5.00 for Car racing</li>
            	<li>20.8 for UNO (a game of chance)</li>
            </ul>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="deflist" nowrap="nowrap">Dynamics Factor (τ)</td>
          <td class="deflist">The Dynamics Factor (τ) models the
            uncertainty in a players skill that is acquired due to
            absence between games. Technically it tries to model the
            fact that while not playing, a player might not be
            practicing and losing skill, or might be practicing and
            gaining skill, we don't know, all we know is that our
            confidence that we know their skill diminishes.<br>
            <p>Left alone TrueSkill will bring the standard deviation
              closer and closer to 0 with every game you play, getting
              more and more confident. </p>
            <p>The Dynamics Factor (τ) is a measure of residual
              uncertainty in this process. It is added to the standard
              deviation (σ) on each update. Thus the higher τ is, the
              less confidence in any given µ there is and the lower τ is
              the more confidence in any given µ there is.</p>
            <p>Technically of course, this might be a reasonable model if
            most or all players have similar spans between games, i.e. are 
            consistently playing. If players have very disparate periods of 
            time between plays it fails in any way to model any difference 
            in their loss of or our uncertainty in, their skill</p>
            <p>The default value in TrueSkill is one hundredth of the
              initial standard deviation (σ<sub>0</sub>), or 25 ÷ 3 ÷
              100, which is about 0.08333...</p>

        <tr>
          <td class="deflist" nowrap="nowrap">Draw Probability (p)</td>
          <td class="deflist">The probability (0 to 1, meaning 0% to
            100%) of a draw occurring in this game.
            <p>This affects the interpretation of draws by TrueSkill. In
              essence if a draw is recorded between two or more players
              TrueSkill will tend to move their means (µ) toward each
              other. If a draw is very likely however, this result says
              little about the individual player skills, and the
              adjustment to µ will be lower, and if a draw is very
              unlikely then scoring a draw suggest much more strongly
              that the players are well matched and the adjustment to µ
              is accordingly higher.</p>
            <p>The default value is 0.1 (or 10%) which is completely
              arbitrary.</p>
            <p>You can of course, with enough game data recorded measure
              the probability of a draw in retrospect. This is another
              reason to independently keep a record of all game results,
              so that you could if desired, recalculate all rankings by
              running each played game through the server once again
              with a different draw probability.</p>

            TrueSkill runs itself in circles adjusting players µ and σ
            values trying to find values that best predict the recorded
            outcome. The smaller δ is the longer it will take but more
            accurate the result will be, and the higher δ is the faster
            the calculation and the less accurate the result will be.
            <p>The default value is 0.0001, an arbitrarily small value.</p>
